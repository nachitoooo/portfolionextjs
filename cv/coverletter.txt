Hello! My name is Ignacio and at 19 years old, I have already had the opportunity to immerse myself in the world of work on several occasions, managing to perform successfully in each role I have assumed.

Thanks to my studies and projects, I have had the opportunity to venture into the field of technology, where I have developed desktop software and custom web pages, using cutting-edge technologies.

I am excited to continue learning and growing professionally, and am confident that my combination of practical experience and IT knowledge allows me to provide significant value in any work environment.
I look forward to having the opportunity to contribute to your team's common goals.
